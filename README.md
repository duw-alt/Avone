## My First Project

A simple `HTML` and `CSS` website with multiple pages and full responsivity using `Bootstrap`.

---

During this project I gained a lot of experience as a begginer.  
I found using Bootstrap along with css and finding a middle ground between quite challenging,  
but at last i got everything working.  
Another difficulty I stumbled upon was responsive design,  
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what would be the most efficient and tidy solution.

**Setup:**  
Doesn't require any setup, just download the files and double-click `index.html`.
